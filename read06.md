# How Computers Work:


## All computers at the end do the sam four essintial things:

1. ***Input***:
   1. keyboard.
   2. muse.
   3. camera ...etc.
2. ***Store*** the Input.
3. ***Process*** the data which stored in memory with the processor.
4. ***Output*** the results.

### ______________________________

## How computers stores the data:

- At the end all types of data will be presented as 1 or 0
- 1,0 means (true,false),(on,off),(white,black).
- Any number can be converted to binary system (1,0)
- Text also can be present by binary system (think of that like link each letter with a number and combine each word by its characters' numbers and so on...)
- Images also consists of pixels, each one represent as (r,g,b) numbers and then will convert to binary numbers.
- Even the sounds, each sound is a waveform that consists of numbers.

### ______________________________


## How computers output the data:

- After storing the data inside the memory.
- The CPU request the information from the memory on how to display this data as pixels.
- Then the CPU do thousends of processes very fast and prepare the data.
- After that the CPU send the data to memory.
- Then it will send to the output divices.

### _______________________________

## Types of outputs:

1. Like Input, the output could be any data you need.
2. It may be images, sounds, texts, videos ...etc.
3. And this data can be presented or send to many divices like:
   1. Screen.
   2. VR.
   3. Speakers.
   4. Games Stations.
   5. Robots.
   6. Motors ...etc.
