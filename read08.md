# Comparison and Logical operators & Loops


### ________________________________________
## Comparison operator:

* We use the comparison operators to compare between two values and return one value which is **True** OR **False**. and that's called Expression
* The comparison operator in Java Script are:

| Te operator | The meaning |
| ---- | ----|
| `>`  | Grater than |
| `<`  | Less than |
| `>=` | Grater OR equal |
| `<=` | Less then OR equal |
| `==` | Equal |
| `!=` | Not Equal |

## Logical Operators:

* You can use logical operators to combine more than one expression and compare between them, then return one value which is **True** OR **False**.

* Except the NOT operator, it will take one value and return the opposite of it.

* The logical operators in Java Script are:

| Te operator | The meaning |
| ---- | ----|
| `&&`  | AND |
| `||`  | OR |
| `!` | NOT |

### The truth table for AND operator:

***It will return True only if both sides are true...***

| The values | The Result |
| ---- | ----|
| `T && T`   | True  |
| `T && F`   | False |
| `F && T`   | False |
| `F && F`   | False |

### The truth table for OR operator:

***It will return False only if both sides are False...***

| The values | The Result |
| ---- | ----|
| `T || T`   | True  |
| `T || F`   | True  |
| `F || T`   | True  |
| `F || F`   | True  |

### The truth table for NOT operator:

***It will return False if the value is True and vice versa...***

| The value | The Result |
| ---- | ----|
| `! T`   | False  |
| `! F`   | True  |

### ________________________________________

## Loops:

* You can use the loop when you want to repeat a block of code many times without to rewrite it.

* There are three types of loops: **(for, while, do while)**

* The difference between them is; 

* You can use for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat the code.

* You can use while loop whenn you want to check some expression at each time.

* Do while, will execute the code at least one time before it checks the condition.

### ________________________________________

### Syntax of for loop:

`for(var i =0; i<10 ; i++){...}`

### Syntax of while loop:

`while(true){do something...}`

### Syntax of do while loop:

`{do something...}while(true)`
