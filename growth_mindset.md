# How to keep your self in a growth mindset:

### always remember that:

1. ***don't compare*** your self with other ( each one has a different background and different knowledges).

2. No one ***born*** as a professional developer ( all of them start from scratch ).

3.If you can't find some solutions, use the magic word (***...yet***). yes you did not find or solve it *yet* but of course you will do it, just keep trying.
