## There is some interesting information about html:


### ________________________________________

### HTML 5 Layout:
* The new ***HTML5*** elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are ***block-level*** elements.

### ________________________________________

### Process & Design:
* It's important to understand who your target audience is.
* why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

### ________________________________________

### Extra markup:
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the `<!-- and -->` markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
