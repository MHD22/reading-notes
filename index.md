### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for


## To create a heading, add one to six # 
( one # ) is the larger header.

**EXs:**

# the largest heading ( one #) 
###### the smallest heading (six #)


## styling the text:
- for bold text use ** some text ** (without spaces between) EX: (**Helloo I'm bold**)   Or you can use __ some text __ (two under scores) instead of stars.

- for italic text use * some text * (without spaces between) EX: (*Helloo I'm italic*)   Or you can use _ some text _ (one under score) instead of star.

- for bold and nested italic text use ** some text to be bold and _ text to be italic and bold _ here it is bold again ** (without spaces between) EX: (**Helloo I'm bold _and I'm italic with bold_ here I'm just bold again**) .

- for all bold and italic use *** some text to be both italic and gold *** EX: ( ***helloo, I'm bold and italic text*** ).

- you can qouting the text using >this is a qoute (with space after '>' directly and it should be on a new line).

EX:

> this is a qoute.

- you can qouting the code using backticks (``)  

EX: 

` git push origin master `

- To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks

EX:

```markdown

# How to keep your self in a growth mindset:

### always remember that:

1. ***don't compare*** your self with other ( each one has a different background and different knowledges).

2. No one ***born*** as a professional developer ( all of them start from scratch ).

3.If you can't find some solutions, use the magic word (***...yet***). yes you did not find or solve it *yet* but of course you will do it, just keep trying.
